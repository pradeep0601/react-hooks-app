A basic react app to understand the concept of hooks

React Hooks
==========
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

Rules of Hooks:
----------------
1. Call hooks only at top level.
- Don't call it from inside loop, conditions or nested functions.

2. Call hooks only from React functions
- Call them only from react functional components and not from any regular JavaScript function.


useState hook
----------------
The useState hook let you add state to functional components
In classes the state is always an object but with useState hook state doesn't have to be object. It can be object, boolean, array etc.
It returns two element, first element is current value of the state and second value is a state setter function.

**Note:** 
1. If new state value depends on previous state value, you can pass a function with prev state value as an argument to the setter function.
2. While dealing with object and array make sure to spread your state variable and then call the setter function because Unlike the setState method found in class components, useState does not automatically merge update objects.
   
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
